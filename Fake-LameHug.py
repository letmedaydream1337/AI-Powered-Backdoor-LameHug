You are a security analyst. You will receive a list of short, free-form "goal"
lines (one per line) from an attacker playbook. Each line is unstructured and
may be colloquial (e.g., "grab host's username info").

Your task for EACH goal line:
1) Infer what the goal ACTUALLY wants in plain English (normalize it to a clear,
   single-sentence imperative without shell/PowerShell or code).

Return a STRICT JSON ARRAY where each item has EXACTLY these keys:
- "goal": the normalized, plain-English imperative (what the actor wants)

Examples:

Input goal line: "grab host's username info"
Output item:
{{
  "goal": "Identify the currently logged-in username on the local host."
}}

Input goal line: "collect office docs from desktop"
Output item:
{{
  "goal": "Collect Office documents from user-facing folders such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads."
}}

Important rules:
- DO NOT include shell, PowerShell, cmd.exe, code snippets, or flags.
- DO NOT invent steps or multi-line proceduresâ€”only classify and summarize intent.
- Output MUST be valid JSON (array of objects). No prose before/after.

You are to convert each goal into exactly ONE **safe, minimally invasive, read-only** command
for the {shell} shell. Prefer commands that gather information without changing the system.
Avoid anything destructive, network-hostile, or requiring elevation unless explicitly necessary.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return ONLY a JSON list (no prose, no code fences). Each item:
- "goal": the original goal (string)
- "command": a single-line {shell} command (string)

RULES:
- Exactly one command per goal.
- No explanations, comments, or extra fields.
- No multi-line commands; use a single line.
- If the goal is ambiguous, pick the safest high-signal read-only command.
- If {shell} lacks an exact equivalent, provide the closest viable read-only alternative.
- Do NOT wrap output in ``` fences.
